# Platform Owner Workflow

Understanding how platform owners manage the CeloRefer system.

## 1. Deploy Contracts

Platform owners deploy the CeloRefer contracts to the Celo network:

**Network:** Celo Sepolia Testnet (Chain ID: 11142220)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|----------|
| CeloReferEnhanced | `0xCCAddAC9Ac91D548ada36684dB2b3796A0c7Ea73` |
| ReputationNFT | `0xe667437aF0424Ee9cb983b755Ccccf218779E37b` |
| cUSD | `0xdE9e4C3ce781b4bA68120d6261cbad65ce0aB00b` |

## 2. Set Platform Fee

Configure the platform fee percentage:

```typescript
// This is typically done by the platform owner
// Platform fee is currently set to 15% (1500 basis points)
const platformFee = await sdk.getPlatformFee();
console.log('Current platform fee:', platformFee / 100, '%');
```

## 3. Authorize Partners

Authorize partner dApps:

```typescript
// Check if a partner is authorized
const isAuthorized = await sdk.isAuthorizedPartner(partnerAddress);
console.log('Partner authorized:', isAuthorized);

// Authorization is typically done by the platform owner
// Partners can have different subscription tiers (0=Free, 1=Basic, 2=Pro, 3=Enterprise)
```

## 4. Create Quests

Create quests for users:

```typescript
// Quest creation is typically done by the platform owner
// Example quest structure:
const questExample = {
  name: "First 5 Referrals",
  description: "Refer 5 users to earn a reward",
  targetReferrals: 5,
  rewardAmount: BigInt(50 * 10**18), // 50 cUSD
  startTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 30 days
};

// Quests are created directly on the contract by the owner
```

## 5. Manage Seasons

Create and manage seasonal competitions:

```typescript
// Season creation is typically done by the platform owner
// Example season structure:
const seasonExample = {
  name: "Summer Challenge",
  description: "Summer referral competition",
  startTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 60 days
  totalPrizePool: BigInt(1000 * 10**18), // 1000 cUSD
  winnersCount: 10
};

// Seasons are created directly on the contract by the owner
```

## 6. Monitor System

Monitor the system performance:

```typescript
// Get system statistics
const stats = await sdk.getContractStats();
console.log('Total users:', stats.totalUsers);
console.log('Total referrals:', stats.totalReferrals);
console.log('Total quests:', stats.totalQuests);
console.log('Total seasons:', stats.totalSeasons);

// Get partner information
const subscription = await sdk.getPartnerSubscription(partnerAddress);
console.log('Partner tier:', subscription.tier);
console.log('Partner status:', subscription.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive');
```

## 7. Collect Platform Fees

Platform fees are automatically collected and sent to the treasury:

```typescript
// Get treasury address
const treasury = await sdk.getTreasury();
console.log('Treasury address:', treasury);

// Platform fees are automatically distributed to the treasury
// No manual withdrawal needed
```

## 8. Emergency Functions

In case of emergencies, platform owners have special functions:

```typescript
// Emergency functions are available only to the contract owner
// These include pause/unpause and emergency withdrawal functions
// They are used only in critical situations
```
