# User Workflow

Understanding the user journey in the CeloRefer system.

## 1. Registration

Users can join the CeloRefer system in two ways:

### With a Referral Code
```typescript
// Register with a referral code
await sdk.registerUser('REFERRAL_CODE');
```

### As a Genesis User
```typescript
// Register without a referral code (genesis user)
await sdk.registerUser();
```

## 2. Get Referral Code

After registration, users receive a unique referral code:

```typescript
const userInfo = await sdk.getUserInfo(userAddress);
console.log(`Your referral code: ${userInfo.referralCode}`);
```

## 3. Share Referral Link

Users can share their referral code with others:
```
https://your-dapp.com/referral?code=USER_REFERRAL_CODE
```

## 4. Earn Rewards

Users earn rewards when their referrals perform actions:

```typescript
// Check earned rewards
const rewards = await sdk.getUserRewards(userAddress);
console.log(`Total earned: ${rewards.totalEarned} cUSD`);
console.log(`Available: ${rewards.available} cUSD`);
```

## 5. Level Up

Users level up based on their referral count:

```typescript
const userInfo = await sdk.getUserInfo(userAddress);
console.log(`Badge tier: ${userInfo.badgeTier}`);
console.log(`Referral count: ${userInfo.referralCount}`);
```

## 6. Participate in Quests

Users can participate in quests:

```typescript
// Get available quests
const quests = await sdk.getAvailableQuests();

// Check progress on a quest
const progress = await sdk.getQuestProgress(questId, userAddress);

// Claim reward when quest is completed
if (progress.completed) {
  await sdk.claimQuestReward(questId);
}
```

## 7. Compete in Seasons

Users can compete in seasonal competitions:

```typescript
// Get current season info
const season = await sdk.getCurrentSeason();

// Check leaderboard position
const position = await sdk.getUserSeasonPosition(season.id, userAddress);
```

## 8. Mint Reputation NFT

Users can mint their reputation NFT:

```typescript
// Check if user has an NFT
const hasNFT = await sdk.hasReputationNFT(userAddress);

// Mint NFT if they don't have one
if (!hasNFT) {
  await sdk.mintReputationNFT();
}
```
