## Badge System

The CeloRefer system includes a tiered badge system based on referral count:

| Tier | Name | Threshold | Level 1 Rate | Level 2 Rate |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| 0 | Bronze | 0+ | 5% | 2% |
| 1 | Silver | 5+ | 6% | 2.5% |
| 2 | Gold | 15+ | 7% | 3% |
| 3 | Platinum | 50+ | 8% | 3.5% |

**Benefits by Tier:**
- **Bronze**: Starting tier for new users
- **Silver**: Improved reward rates + quest access
- **Gold**: Premium features + priority support
- **Platinum**: Elite status + maximum benefits + exclusive perks

## Reward Structure

**Multi-Level Referral System:**
- **Level 1 (Direct Referrer)**: Dynamic rate based on badge tier (5-8%)
- **Level 2 (Grandparent)**: Dynamic rate based on badge tier (2-3.5%)

**Platform Fee:** 15% (goes to treasury for sustainability)

**Reward Distribution:**
1. User performs action (e.g., stakes 100 cUSD)
2. Platform fee deducted (15 cUSD to treasury)
3. Remaining 85 cUSD distributed:
   - Direct referrer gets their tier rate (e.g., 5% = 4.25 cUSD)
   - Level 2 referrer gets their tier rate (e.g., 2% = 1.7 cUSD)
   - Rest goes to user's activity
