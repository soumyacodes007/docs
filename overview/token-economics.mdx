### Example (Bronze Tier User):
- Direct Referrer (Level 1): 0.85 Ã— 5% = 0.0425 cUSD
- Parent Referrer (Level 2): 0.85 Ã— 2% = 0.017 cUSD
- Platform keeps: 0.15 cUSD
- User/Partner keeps: ~0.7905 cUSD

### Example (Platinum Tier User):
- Direct Referrer (Level 1): 0.85 Ã— 8% = 0.068 cUSD
- Parent Referrer (Level 2): 0.85 Ã— 3.5% = 0.02975 cUSD
- Platform keeps: 0.15 cUSD
- User/Partner keeps: ~0.75225 cUSD

## Dynamic Reward Rates

Reward rates are based on user badge tiers:

| Badge Tier | Referrals | Level 1 Reward | Level 2 Reward |
|------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| ðŸ¥‰ Bronze | 0+ | 5% | 2% |
| ðŸ¥ˆ Silver | 5+ | 6% | 2.5% |
| ðŸ¥‡ Gold | 15+ | 7% | 3% |
| ðŸ’Ž Platinum | 50+ | 8% | 3.5% |

## Badge System

Users earn badges based on their referral performance:

- Visual representation of user achievement
- Gamification encourages viral growth

### Badge Requirements

| Badge | Minimum Referrals | Maximum Referrals |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Bronze | 0 | 4 |
| Silver | 5 | 14 |
| Gold | 15 | 49 |
| Platinum | 50 | âˆž |

## Quest Rewards

Quests provide additional incentive for user engagement:
- Set target referral counts
- Offer cUSD rewards for completion
- Track user progress automatically
- Claim rewards on completion
- Drive specific user behaviors

### Example Quest Structure
```typescript
{
  name: "First 5 Referrals",
  targetReferrals: 5,
  rewardAmount: BigInt(50 * 10**18), // 50 cUSD
  startTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 30 days
}
```

## Seasonal Competitions

Seasonal competitions create time-bound engagement spikes:
- Define season duration and prize pool
- Track user performance during season
- Distribute rewards to top performers
- Create urgency and engagement spikes
- Build community around leaderboards

### Example Season Structure
```typescript
{
  name: "Summer Challenge",
  description: "Summer referral competition",
  startTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 60 days
  totalPrizePool: BigInt(1000 * 10**18), // 1000 cUSD
